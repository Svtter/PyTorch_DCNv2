# DCNv2
A simple version of Deformable Convolution Network V2

This project inherits from https://github.com/developer0hye/PyTorch-Deformable-Convolution-v2. I also referred the official DCNv2 project.

You don't have to worry about how to install DCNv2 anymore, you just need to `from DCN.dcnv2 import DeformableConv2d as DCN` to use DCNv2. 

It is very easy and convenient.

# Requirement
This project has passed the test of Torch >= 1.9.1 and Torchvision >= 0.10.1.
